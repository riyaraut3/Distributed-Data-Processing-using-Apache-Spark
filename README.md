## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

- **Data Ingestion:** Loading JSON, CSV, and Parquet files using the DataFrame API  
- **Schema Handling:** Inferring, defining, and transforming schemas  
- **Transformations:** Filtering, joining, grouping, and aggregating data  
- **Window Functions:** Rank, dense rank, row number, cumulative aggregations  
- **User Defined Functions (UDFs):** Creating and applying custom logic  
- **Performance Optimization:** Caching, partitioning, and file format considerations  
- **SQL Integration:** Registering temporary views and querying with SQL  
- **Output:** Writing results back to storage in multiple formats
